    please follow the instruction below
    create a package named primepackage
    inside the primepackage create a class primeGenerator
    inside the prime generator class, implement a static method generatePrime that takes ana integer 'n'
         as input and returns and array of the first 'n' prime number.
         in the main class not inside any package do the following
         1. > import the necessary class from the primepackage package
         2.> take an integer 'n' as input from the user to specify how many prime number to generate
         3.> use the generatePrime method to generate the first 'n' prime numbers
         4.> print the generated prime numbers to the console ." input 5
